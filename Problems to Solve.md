# Problems to Solve

After a few weeks of searching,  I found these problems kept popping up.

## Repetitive Work on Reading Job Posts
When looking at tens of job listings a day, I found myself re-reading some of the same posts. It was difficult to keep track of which ones I had looked at and why I had rejected them.

I wanted to filter quickly to the jobs that _were_ interesting. And then I wanted to capture my thoughts about the job so I could revisit them later.

## Company Research
So much about a job listing for me was finding out key information about a Company. How big are they? What level of funding do they have? Who do I know that works there, or used to work there?

I wanted to have this information available, much like a job listing, so that I could revisit it later, adding notes as I discoverd more and as I considered the job.

## Managing The Life Cycle of a Job Post
Once a job posting was interesting, how do I decide when to apply? And once I have applied, how do I know the status of the application? And if an application ended, or I decided I did not want to apply, I wanted to know _why_. 

This was especially helpful when job were re-posted or companies posted different, possibly interesting jobs. More than once, I ran into the case of, "That Company ghosted my application, so why would I apply again?"

I discovered a life cycle (of sorts) to a job post and I wanted to track it.

## Managing Resumes and Cover Letters
Each job application should have a custom cover letter. And often, I would edit a resume to highlight specific points for a company. That's a lot of PDFs.

Keeping track of all of these documents needed some management.

## Notes During Interviews
A job interview involves many discussions with people. I wanted to have good notes from all of these discussions to help me during the process. 

I wanted to be able to search those notes, find patterns, and cross-link them to aid in the decisions.

## Which Job Sites Are Valuable?
There are a bundle of job sites. Should I use them all? Were some of them better than others?

I wanted to filter this down to a manageable list of sites that gave me the most value.
