# Network

People you've worked with is probably one of the best signals for wanting to work at another company.

Find the people you want to work with again and schedule a chat. Find out more about their current context - the company, their role, general and specific impressions. Take notes from the conversation in a note.  The questions in [[TemplatePersonalProfile]] is a good start for what to ask.

Remember that people _love_ referrals. Use them before applying blindly.

# To Do
- [ ] Review your 1st-level network at [[LinkedIn]]
- [ ] Make note of people you want to work with again
- [ ] Schedule some meetings and take notes
