# So you have started a job search...

I have been in the middle of one for a while. And like any good software engineer, I've iterated and tweaked my process over the search. This [Obsidian][obs] Notebook is a capture of my process as it stands today. Your mileage _will_ vary. But if the list of problems below resonates, then perhaps what I've learned and done will help you. After all, a job search can be onerous and/or daunting. Every little bit helps.

I tried a few versions of keeping this data structured - say, in a spreadsheet or database. But I've found that Obsidian's search and cross-linking has been much easier to use for me.

If you are already an Obsidian user, consider incorporating these steps to your daily journaling. If you are not an Obsidian user, I talk more about how I use Obsidian in [this blog series][dwf-obs].

# Getting Started
## For `git` Users
```
git clone https://github.com/infews/job_search_in_obsidian
```

## For Everyone Else

Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/infews/job_search_in_obsidian/releases) page and download the zip file.

## For Obsidian Users
... and then open in Obsidian as a separate Vault.

## For Everyone Else
If you don't have Obsidian yet, the [Obsidian][obs] site can help you get started with the app. 

If you would rather save Obsidian for another time, this Notebook is just a directory of text files that should be viewable in any text editor.

# How to Navigate This Notebook

- Read the [[Problems to Solve]] to understand the justification
- Review [[How to Track It All]] to learn what I do
- Consider what helps you. Take what you like, leave what you don't, iterate until you have what works for you


# Other Thoughts
- Just the activity of looking a lot does raise your profile. 
- People you know will find you. 
	- Some of my most interesting opportunities are from ex-coworkers who heard I was looking, or came up after a recent chat.
- Keep at it.
