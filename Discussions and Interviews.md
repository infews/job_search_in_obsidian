Once you have decided to apply, you are likely to have several touch points with the Company. Pre-interview discussions with recruiters, screens with hiring managers, etc. And if things are going well you will have an interview.

Take notes about each of these interactions in a [[Daily Routine|daily journal]] note on the day it happens. In your Calendar section, I recommend a heading something like:

```markdown
# Calendar

## 0230p Christina @ [[Everything Imaging]]

(notes from the call/meeting)
```

Then make a backlink in the [[Research Note]] "Timeline" section like this:

```markdown
# Timeline

- [[2021.08.05]] Screening Phone call with Billy
- [[2021.08.17]] Christina interview via Zoom
```

Now you have all of the interactions, work you do for the role (say, interview homework), etc., in one place for review later. 

Or... you're going to be ghosted. Give them a couple of weeks before you demote the card on the [[Kanban Board]].

# Questions and Answers
_AKA: Key Stories from your experience_

You will probably get a lot of similar questions during your search. And you will likely refine how you want to answer them. For example, as a manager I've been asked several versions of the question, "Tell me about the time you managed someone through a performance problem."

I now keep a separate note with these questions and rough sketches of how I like to answer them. This is very helpful in remote screens - thanks, COVID. But reviewing these before an in-person interview would be easy as well.
