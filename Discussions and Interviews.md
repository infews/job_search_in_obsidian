Once you have decided to apply, you are likely to have several touch points with the Company. Pre-interview discussions with recruiters, screens with hiring managers, etc. And if things are going well you will have an interview.

Take notes on each of these interactions in a [[Daily Routine|daily journal]] note.

Or you're going to be ghosted. Give them a couple of weeks before you demote the card on the [[Kanban Board]].

You will probably get a lot of similar questions during your search. And you will likely refine how you want to answer them. For example, as a manager I've been asked several versions of the question, "Tell me about the time you managed someone through a performance problem."

I now keep a separate note with these questions and rough sketches of how I like to answer them. This is very helpful in remote screens - thanks, COVID. But reviewing these before an in-person interview would be easy as well.
