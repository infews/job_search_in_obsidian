# When Considering a Role

1. Make a new Note
2. Name it for the _Company_
3. Insert the template: [[TemplateJobSearch]]
	- The template should fill out the top 
4. Fill out the links at the bottom
5. Fill out the sections
	- specially [[Network]] links

Feel free to update the [[TempateJobSearch]] with aditional sections as you need. What information is important to you?

The Notes section is good for links back to your daily notes where you have notes on [[Discussions and Interviews]].

# Other Research

- [Crunchbase][cb]

YMMV, so feel free to update the template.

I use this note for _nearly_ every note I take about the company. I also link back to daily notes as needed.

Make sure to use the Obsidian link to the [[Considering this Role]] note in your [[Kanban Board]].
