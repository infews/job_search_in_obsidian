# Thoughts on LinkedIn for Job Searching

Given you're on a job search, I'm going to assume that you've already spruced up your LinkedIn profile.

## Profile

- Update your profile with good info from your history
- Mark that you are "open to work" so that folks find you
- Use the unique URL feature, it just looks more professional

## Job Listings
- The job postings are often very detailed
- They support [[Saved Searches]]
	- See the [jobs page][lijobs]
- Each posting has easy links to -
	- Company
	- People you know who work there - remember, [[Use your Network]]
	- Some of it is managed by the company, thus more pro-company bias than [[Glassdoor]]
	- Link to apply

## LinkedIn Premium
I've invested in LinkedIn Premium. I like it.

- Cost
	- $30/month
		- Trial period is worth checking out
- You get these types of additional data
	- Salary info (sometimes)
	- Number of applicants
- The [jobs page][lijobs] adds a sections for "Jobs where you are a top applicant"
	- The matches are interesting
- More details on views of your profile
	- Who's checking you out is interesting signal
	- Many companies will ghost you; this helps you find out if you made it past the first filter
- Other features are listed on the [LinkedIn Premium home][lip]

## To Do
- [ ] Sign up for Premium 
- [ ] Make some [[saved searches]]
