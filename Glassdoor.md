# Thoughts on Glassdoor
- There are fewer relevant job postings
- Most jobs I've found are _also_ listed at [[LinkedIn]]
- But Company Research is very helpful, especially considering employee sentiment
- Daily emails of results from saved searches work well

## To Do
- [ ] Sign up
- [ ] Make some [[saved searches]]
- [ ] Process the emails daily
