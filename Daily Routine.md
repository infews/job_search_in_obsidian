A job search is about persistence. Persistance is easiest with well formed habits. I've found that this process works pretty well for me. 

## Daily Journal

I have a daily journal in Obsidian. Try the [[TemplateObsDaily]] template as a good starting point. But I take daily notes from [[Discussions and Interviews]] here. I then cross-link to the [[Considering this Role]] notes.

## Daily Routine

1. Check LinkedIn
	1. Review Saved Searches
	2. Review Recommended Jobs
	3. Poke around a bit for other jobs
	4. Keep interesting jobs each in a separate tab
2. Check Glassdoor
	1. Review jobs from daily email
	2. Poke around a bit for other jobs
	3. Keep interesting jobs each in a separate tab
3. Check Google (once a week)
	1. Keep interesting jobs each in a separate tab
4. For each open job tab
	- Make [[Considering this Role|one note per company role]], following the instructions there
	- Put it in the Considering column on the [[Kanban Board]]
	- Link the card back to the [[Considering this Role]] note
5. Schedule one call in your [[Network]]
	- Can be for a known role from your research
	- Can be just for catching up or fishing for roles and ideas
